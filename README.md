Description:

Allows user to log into Google, and select from any number of their calendars, any range of dates, and any range of time, and then
shows the appointments (their summary, date, and times) which will overlap with the selected time range, then lists blocks of free time in the
same date/time range.

Known bugs:
My test suite is horribly broken. I didn't have time to fix it.
